## Quick Run
- Enter the `hw1/filter_without_buffer/build/` folder, then run `make run` to see the result of [lake_noise.bmp](https://github.com/PaulWang0513/Electronic-System-Level-Design-and-Synthesis/blob/main/hw1/noise_images/lake_noise.bmp) as out.bmp in hw1/filter_without_buffer/output/ folder.
- Enter the `hw1/filter_with_buffer/build/` folder, then run `make run` to see the result of [jetplane.bmp](https://github.com/PaulWang0513/Electronic-System-Level-Design-and-Synthesis/blob/main/hw1/noise_images/jetplane_noise.bmp) as out.bmp in hw1/filter_with_buffer/output/ folder.
